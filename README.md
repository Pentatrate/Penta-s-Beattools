BeatBlock Text Group Generator

by Pentatrate

You should only use this tool if you know what you're doing as step 3 requires you to have minimal knowledge of how to code.

# HOW TO USE:
0. Save your level. Beatblock may crash when you make an error here.


1. Copy the .png file and the .json file into your level files.


2. Copy and paste the contents of the .js file into a text editor, preferably a rich text editor like VSCode.
3. Use the commented functions to build and animate your text groups similarly to using deco events.
	The comments and example code will help you.


4. Open a new tab in your browser.
5. Open the console/developer tools there (Ctrl + Shift + I in Google).
6. Copy and paste everything from the text editor your console and press Enter.


7. Create a new tag at time 0 in the editor using temporary events.
8. Open the tag file (tagName.json) in a text editor and delete everything in it.
9. Copy and paste the large text from the console into the tag file and save the file.
10. You can immediately playtest your changes ingame.
